## Incident Severity Levels

### Level 1: Critical (Immediate Response Required)

- Gas optimization issues
- Non-critical feature failures

## Emergency Response Team

### Primary Contacts
1. **Technical Lead**: Deploy fixes, execute pauses
2. **Security Lead**: Analyze threats, coordinate response
3. **Treasury Multisig**: Execute emergency functions
4. **Communications**: User notifications, social media

### Backup Contacts
- Additional developers with system knowledge
- Legal counsel for regulatory issues
- PR team for public communications

## Response Procedures by Contract

### 1. BOGOTokenV2 Emergency Procedures

#### Pause Token Transfers
```solidity
// Who: PAUSER_ROLE holder
// When: Exploit detected, unusual activity
bogoToken.pause();
```

#### Resume Operations
```solidity
// Who: PAUSER_ROLE holder
// When: Issue resolved, system secured
bogoToken.unpause();
```

### 2. MultisigTreasury Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency ETH Withdrawal
```solidity
// Who: Threshold signers during pause
// When: Contract compromise suspected
treasury.emergencyWithdrawETH(safeAddress, amount);
```

#### Pause Treasury Operations
```solidity
// Who: Multisig execution
// When: Suspicious transaction patterns
treasury.pause();
```

### 3. BOGORewardDistributor Emergency Procedures

#### Pause Reward Distribution
```solidity
// Who: Treasury/Admin
// When: Exploit or drain attempt
rewardDistributor.pause();
```

#### Emergency Token Recovery
```solidity
// Who: Treasury
// When: Tokens stuck or at risk
rewardDistributor.treasurySweep(token, safeAddress, amount);
```

## Specific Scenarios and Responses

### Scenario 1: Token Minting Exploit
**Detection**: Unusual minting patterns, supply irregularities

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Pause token contract
2. Analyze minting transactions
3. Identify exploit vector
4. Revoke compromised roles

**Recovery**:
1. Deploy fixed reward distributor if needed
2. Update registry to point to new contract
3. Communicate with affected users
4. Resume operations

### Scenario 2: Treasury Drain Attempt
**Detection**: Large withdrawal requests, unusual signer activity

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Pause treasury contract
2. Cancel pending transactions
3. Review all recent confirmations
4. Check signer accounts for compromise

**Recovery**:
1. Remove compromised signers
2. Add new secure signers
3. Update threshold if needed
4. Resume with enhanced monitoring

### Scenario 3: Reward Distribution Bug
**Detection**: Incorrect reward amounts, failed claims

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Pause reward distributor
2. Stop backend automation
3. Analyze affected users
4. Calculate correct distributions

**Recovery**:
1. Deploy new distributor via registry
2. Import user states if needed
3. Compensate affected users
4. Resume with fixes

### Scenario 4: Gas Price Attack
**Detection**: Transactions failing due to gas limits

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Monitor network conditions
2. Adjust gas strategies
3. Prioritize critical operations
4. Communicate delays to users

**Recovery**:
1. Wait for network normalization
2. Process backlog carefully
3. Consider batching operations
4. Update gas limits if needed

## Migration Procedures

### When Migration is Necessary
1. Critical vulnerability discovered
2. Major feature addition required
3. Regulatory compliance changes
4. Community governance decision

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare New Contract
```bash
# Deploy new version
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-new-version.js --network mainnet

# Verify contract
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

#### Step 2: Update Registry
```solidity
// Update registry to point to new contract
registry.updateContract("RewardDistributor", newDistributorAddress);
```

#### Step 3: Pause Old Contract
```solidity
// Pause and deprecate old version
oldDistributor.pause();
oldDistributor.deprecate(newDistributorAddress);
```

#### Step 4: Migrate State (if needed)
```solidity
// Use migration helper
migrationHelper.batchMarkMigrated(oldContract, users);
```

#### Step 5: Communicate Changes
- Update documentation
- Notify users via all channels
- Update frontend to use new addresses
- Monitor for issues

2. Review and update procedures
3. Analyze past incidents
4. Update monitoring thresholds

## Post-Incident Checklist

- [ ] All systems operational
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Fix implemented and tested
- [ ] Users compensated (if needed)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Public report published
- [ ] Monitoring enhanced
- [ ] Team debrief completed

## Recovery Time Objectives

| System | Target Recovery Time |
|--------|---------------------|
| Token Transfers | < 2 hours |
| Treasury Operations | < 4 hours |
| Reward Distribution | < 6 hours |
| Full System | < 24 hours |

## Legal and Compliance

### Regulatory Notifications
- [ ] Legal counsel informed
- [ ] Regulatory filings (if required)

## Conclusion

These procedures ensure rapid response to emergencies without requiring contract upgrades. The combination of pause mechanisms, treasury recovery, registry patterns, and clear communication protocols provides robust protection while maintaining the security benefits of immutable contracts.

**Remember**: It's better to pause quickly and investigate than to allow potential exploits to continue. User trust is maintained through transparency and rapid, effective response.
