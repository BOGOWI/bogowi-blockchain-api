Security Fix: Single Owner Vulnerability in BOGORewardDistributor

ISSUE SUMMARY
Severity: CRITICAL  
Contract: BOGORewardDistributor.sol  
Issue: Contract uses single-owner control (Ownable) instead of multisig  
Risk: Complete system compromise if owner key is compromised  

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

Changes Made:

1. Removed Single Owner Control
   - Removed inheritance from OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract
   - Eliminated single point of failure

2. Integrated MultisigTreasury Control
   - Added immutable treasury address variable
   - Created onlyTreasury modifier for admin functions
   - All admin functions now require multisig approval

3. Updated Constructor
   - Now requires treasury address as parameter
   - Validates treasury address is not zero

4. Modified Admin Functions
   - pause() / unpause() - Now requires treasury multisig
   - addToWhitelist() - Now requires treasury multisig  
   - removeFromWhitelist() - Now requires treasury multisig
   - setAuthorizedBackend() - Now requires treasury multisig
   - updateTemplate() - Now requires treasury multisig

DEPLOYMENT CHANGES

The deployment script has been updated to:
1. Require MULTISIG_TREASURY_ADDRESS environment variable
2. Pass treasury address to constructor
3. Update deployment documentation

USAGE EXAMPLE

To execute admin functions through multisig:

// 1. Signer submits transaction to treasury
const pauseData = rewardDistributor.interface.encodeFunctionData("pause");
await treasury.connect(signer1).submitTransaction(
  rewardDistributor.address,
  0,
  pauseData,
  "Pause reward distributor"
);

// 2. Other signers confirm (auto-executes after threshold)
await treasury.connect(signer2).confirmTransaction(0);

SECURITY BENEFITS

1. No Single Point of Failure: Multiple signers must approve admin actions
2. Time Delay: Treasury has execution delay for added security
3. Transparency: All admin actions are recorded on-chain
4. Revocability: Transactions can be revoked before execution

TESTING

Comprehensive test suite created in test/BOGORewardDistributor.multisig.test.js covering:
- Access control verification
- Multisig admin operations
- Normal user operations
- Security edge cases

MIGRATION NOTES

For existing deployments:
1. Deploy new BOGORewardDistributor with treasury address
2. Transfer token balance from old contract
3. Update backend configurations
4. Migrate whitelists and settings through multisig
