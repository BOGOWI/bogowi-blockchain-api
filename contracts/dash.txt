Standard Token Distribution Monitoring Practices:

  1. Admin Dashboard (Private)

  - Real-time metrics: Daily/weekly/monthly distribution rates
  - User analytics: Active claimers, referral chains, whale activity
  - Treasury health: Remaining rewards, burn rate projections
  - Fraud detection: Unusual claiming patterns, bot detection
  - Whitelist management: Add/remove founders, view status

  2. Public Dashboard (Transparency)

  - Total distributed: Running total of rewards given
  - Active users: Number of unique claimers
  - Distribution rate: Current daily limit usage
  - Treasury balance: Remaining rewards available
  - Recent claims: Live feed of distributions

  3. Key Metrics to Track:

  - Distribution velocity (tokens/day)
  - User acquisition cost (tokens per new user)
  - Retention metrics (repeat claimers)
  - Geographic distribution
  - Claim type breakdown (welcome, referral, etc.)
  - Gas costs vs reward ratios

  4. Implementation Options:

  Option A: Web3 Dashboard (Recommended)
  - React/Next.js frontend
  - Direct blockchain queries
  - Real-time event monitoring
  - CSV export capabilities

  Option B: Backend Analytics
  - Index all events in database
  - GraphQL/REST API
  - Historical analysis
  - Alert system for anomalies

  Option C: Third-party Tools
  - Dune Analytics dashboards
  - The Graph Protocol subgraphs
  - Flipside Crypto queries
  - Custom Etherscan labels

  5. Security Considerations:

  - Read-only blockchain access
  - No private keys in frontend
  - Rate limiting on queries
  - Authentication for admin features
  - Audit trail for admin actions

  Would you like me to create:
  1. A script to monitor distribution metrics?
  2. A simple web dashboard template?
  3. Database schema for tracking events?
  4. Dune Analytics queries for public metrics?
